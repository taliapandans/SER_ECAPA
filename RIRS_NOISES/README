This data includes all the room impulse responses (RIRs) and noises
we used in our paper "A Study on Data Augmentation of Reverberant Speech for Robust Speech Recognition"
submitted to ICASSP 2017.
The RIRs and noises in this data are all in 16k sampling rate and 16-bit precision.

Here are the descriptions for each folder in this data:

pointsource_noises: 

The point-source noises
are sampled from the Freesound portion of the MUSAN corpus.
This portion of the corpus contains 843 noise
recordings and each of them is manually classified as either
a foreground or a background noise.
The MUSAN corpus can be downloaded by
wget http://www.openslr.org/resources/17/musan.tar.gz


real_rirs_isotropic_noises:

The set of real RIRs is composed of three databases:
the RWCP sound scene database, the 2014 REVERB challenge
database and the Aachen impulse response database (AIR).
Overall there are 325 real RIRs.
The isotropic noises available in the real RIR databases are
used along with the associated RIRs.
